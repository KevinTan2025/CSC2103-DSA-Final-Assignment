# ðŸ§® Coin Change Problem â€” Minimum Number of Coins (Bottom-Up DP)
# Based on algorithm from GeeksforGeeks
#
# PROBLEM: Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum
# number of coins needed to make that amount, and show the exact breakdown.
#
# ALGORITHM: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Tabulation)
# - Time Complexity: O(target Ã— number_of_coins)
# - Space Complexity: O(target)
# - Uses parent tracking to reconstruct the optimal coin combination
#
# APPROACH:
# 1. Build a DP table where dp[i] = minimum coins needed for amount i
# 2. Track parent array to remember which coin was used for each amount
# 3. Reconstruct solution by backtracking through parent array
# 4. Display exact breakdown showing count of each coin denomination
